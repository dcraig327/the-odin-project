## 1. Foundations

### 1.1. Introduction

#### 1.1.1. How This Course Will Work

This curriculum works by aggregating the best content from across the internet to teach a specific topic. In each lesson, we’ll introduce the topic and try to provide some useful context before pointing you to external resources made by others.

One of the most difficult parts about this course is adopting the right mindset. An even bigger challenge is learning the core ideas of programming. It isn’t just about coding, it is about problem-solving, asking the right questions, and doing enough research.

This is exactly what The Odin Project is about: developing these skills. After completing the course you will be in a position where you can simply jump straight into the documentation for anything you are trying to learn.

The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.

The goal of The Odin Project is to provide a complete path for students to go from zero programming knowledge to employed as web developers while working with other students and picking up the skills to become self sufficient along the way.

> Who is "Odin"? :trident:

Odin is a figure from Norse mythology, the allfather of the gods. He is portrayed as powerful and fickle (as they often are) but also wise and cunning. Learning web development is not an easy task and the tools laid out here are merely the path; you must walk it yourself. Should you possess a thirst for knowledge and persistence of spirit akin to that storied in Odin's mythos, you will find success on your journey.
